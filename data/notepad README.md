# Real Estate Price Prediction 🏠

This project uses **Machine Learning** (Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict house prices based on the Kaggle dataset: *House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques*.

## Project Structure
- `data/` → contains raw and processed data (train.csv, test.csv, submission.csv)
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks (exploration, modeling, etc.)
- `src/` → source code and saved models
- `figures/` → plots and charts
- `README.md` → project documentation

## Results
- Baseline (Random Forest): **0.33593**
- XGBoost: **0.25687**

## Next Steps
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Feature engineering
- Ensemble models
